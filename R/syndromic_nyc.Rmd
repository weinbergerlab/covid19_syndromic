```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = normalizePath("..")) #sets Working directory to be 1 folder up

```

```{r}
ili1<- read.table('./Data/ILI_2020_3_8.csv',sep="\t", header=TRUE, skipNul = T) 

names(ili1)<-c('note','syndrome','geo.level','borough','ag.level','age_group','date','metric', 'count')

ili1<-ili1[,c('borough','age_group','date','count')]
